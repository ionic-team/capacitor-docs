# Updating from Capacitor 3 to Capacitor 4

Compared to previous upgrades, the breaking changes between Capacitor 3 and 4 is fairly minimal. In this guide, you'll find steps to update your project to the current Capacitor 4 version as well as a list of breaking changes for our official plugins.

## iOS

The following guide describes how to upgrade your Capacitor 3 iOS project to Capacitor 4.

### Raise iOS Deployment Target

Do the following for your Xcode project: select the **Project** within the project editor and open the **Build Settings** tab. Under the **Deployment** section, change **iOS Deployment Target** to **iOS 13.0**. Repeat the same steps for any app **Targets**.

Then, open¬†`ios/App/Podfile`¬†and update the iOS version to 13.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
```

### Remove Unnecessary Code

Remove unused `touchesBegan` method from `AppDelegate.swift`

```diff
-override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) {
-  super.touchesBegan(touches, with: event)
-
-  let statusBarRect = UIApplication.shared.statusBarFrame
-  guard let touchPoint = event?.allTouches?.first?.location(in: self.window) else { return }
-
-  if statusBarRect.contains(touchPoint) {
-      NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .capacitorStatusBarTapped, object: nil)
-  }
-}
```

## Android

The following guide describes how to upgrade your Capacitor 3 Android project to Capacitor 4.

### Update Android Project Variables

In your `variables.gradle` file, update your values to the following new minimums

```groovy
minSdkVersion = 22
compileSdkVersion = 32
targetSdkVersion = 32
androidxActivityVersion = '1.4.0'
androidxAppCompatVersion = '1.4.1'
androidxCoordinatorLayoutVersion = '1.2.0'
androidxCoreVersion = '1.7.0'
androidxFragmentVersion = '1.4.1'
junitVersion = '4.13.2'
androidxJunitVersion = '1.1.3'
androidxEspressoCoreVersion = '3.4.0'
cordovaAndroidVersion = '10.1.1'
```

### Add `android:exported` tag to your Android Manifest

In your `AndroidManifest.xml` file, you'll need to add the following line to the `<activity>` tag.

```xml
android:exported="true"
```

This tag ensures that you can open this "Activity," or screen, in your app. For more information on this and other tags, check out [Android's `<activity>` reference documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element?hl=en).

:::info
By default, your `AndroidManifest.xml` will be located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
:::

### Update to Gradle 7

Android Studio provides an automatic migration to Gradle 7. Go ahead and take them up on the offer! To upgrade, go to your `build.gradle` file, and click on the üí° icon, and click "Upgrade Gradle." Once your project is migrated over, run a gradle sync by clicking on the Elephant Icon in the top right of Android Studio.

### Ensure you are using Java 11

Capacitor 3 works with both Java 8 and Java 11. Moving forward, Capacitor 4 will only support Java 11. You can change this in your project by going to the following menu in Android Studio:

`Preferences > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle`

<img
  src={require('/img/v4/docs/main/updating/android-java-11.png').default}
  loading="eager"
/>

From there, you can modify the "Gradle JDK" to be Java 11.

:::info
Java 11 ships with the latest version of Android Studio. No additional downloads needed!
:::

### Optional: Remove `jcenter()` from your Gradle files

In previous Capacitor versions, `jcenter()` was required due to our Cordova compatibility layer being hosted on Jcenter. However, we are now using the latest Cordova Android version, hosted on Maven Central. With this, you may be able to remove `jcenter()` entirely from your `build.gradle` file. If you are using other plugins or native dependencies, make sure they aren't hosted on Jcenter before removing it!

## Plugins

The following plugin functions have been modified or removed. Update your code accordingly.

### Storage

The `@capacitor/storage` plugin has been renamed to `@capacitor/preferences` to better reflect it's usage. The API remains the same.

### Camera

- The setting `preserveAspectRatio` has been removed.
- The plugin will no longer alert that iOS usage descriptions are missing.

### Action Sheet

- `ShowActionsOptions.title` is now optional.

#### iOS Only

- `buildActionSheet` title and message is now optional.

### Push Notifications 

- Added new type, `RegistrationError`, for `registrationError` event.
- `importance` is now optional.  Defaults to `3`.
- `deleteChannel` now only accepts the channel id instead of the whole object.

### Local Notifications

- `importance` is now optional.  Defaults to `3`.
- `deleteChannel` now only accepts the channel id instead of the whole object.

### App

- `App.exitApp()` now returns a promise.

### Geolocation

- Timeout is now ignored for getCurrentPosition

### FileSystem

- `copy` now returns path of the copied file.
- `ReaddirResult` now returns an array of `FileInfo` objects, which contain metadata related to each file in addition to its URI.

### Device

- `model` now returns the exact model on iOS (from ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù to ‚ÄúiPhone13.4‚Äù).

### Dialog

- `title` is now optional.

### Keyboard

- `style` config option now uses the `KeyboardStyle` enum for options.
