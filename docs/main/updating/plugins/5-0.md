# Updating Capacitor to 5.0 in your plugin

## iOS
### Changes to CAPBridgedPlugin protocol

`CAPBridgedPlugin` protocol requirements have been moved to the instance level instead of the class level. `pluginId` was renamed `identifier` to avoid clashing with `CAPPlugin.pluginId` and the `getMethod(_:)` requirement was removed altogether and put into an internal extension method. `pluginMethods` was also updated to be more specific about its contents (was `Any` now is `CAPPluginMethod`). The vast majority of users should not experience any issues since the status quo is to use the macro to generate conformance to `CAPBridgedPlugin`. Any users who cast to `CAPBridgedPlugin` to or manually conform to `CAPBridgedPlugin` without the macro will be affected.



## Android

### PluginCall.getObject() / PluginCall.getArray()
To match iOS behavior, `PluginCall.getObject()` and `PluginCall.getArray()` can now return null.  We recommend plugin authors to perform null checks around code handling returns from either of these methods.
