# Updating from Capacitor 7 to Capacitor 8

In this guide, you'll find steps to update your project to the current Capacitor 8 version as well as a list of breaking changes for our official plugins.


## Breaking changes in Capacitor config file

`appendUserAgent` had a bug on iOS that appended two whitespaces before appending the user agent and has been fixed. If you want to prevent the user agent change, add an extra whitespace on `ios.appendUserAgent`. Don't do it on the root `appendUserAgent` as it will also add the whitespace on Android.

TODO - waiting for system bars plugin as it might change some config values

## Breaking changes in @capacitor/cli

Capacitor CLI now creates iOS SPM projects as default.
While it doesn't affect existing apps, if you remove the `ios` folder and run `npx cap add ios` again, it will be created using the SPM template, if you want to use the CocoaPods template, run `npx cap add ios --packagemanager CocoaPods` instead.

## Breaking changes in @capacitor/android

`bridge_layout_main.xml` file has been removed, if you were referencing it in your app code or in plugin code, use `capacitor_bridge_layout_main.xml` instead.

## Breaking changes in @capacitor/ios

Capacitor now emits `CAPBridgeViewController`'s notifications for `viewDidAppear` and for `viewWillTransition`, if you're using `CAPBridgeViewController` extensions to emit those events you should remove them.

## NodeJS 22+

Capacitor 8 requires NodeJS 22 or greater. (Latest LTS version is recommended.)

## Using the CLI to Migrate

Install the `latest` version of the Capacitor CLI to your project:

```sh
npm i -D @capacitor/cli@latest
```

Once installed, simply run the following to have the CLI handle the migration for you.

```sh
npx cap migrate
```

If any of the steps for the migration are not able to be completed, additional information will be made available in the output in the terminal. The steps for doing the migration manually are listed out below.

## iOS

The following guide describes how to upgrade your Capacitor 7 iOS project to Capacitor 8.

### Upgrade Xcode

Capacitor 8 requires Xcode 26.0+.

### Raise iOS Deployment Target

Do the following for your Xcode project: select the **Project** within the project editor and open the **Build Settings** tab. Under the **Deployment** section, change **iOS Deployment Target** to **iOS 15.0**. Repeat the same steps for any app **Targets**.

Then, if the project is using CocoaPods, open `ios/App/Podfile` and update the iOS version to 15.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '15.0'
```

## Android

The following guide describes how to upgrade your Capacitor 7 Android project to Capacitor 8.

### Upgrade Android Studio

Capacitor 8 requires Android Studio Otter | 2025.2.1 or newer.

Once it's updated, Android Studio can assist with some of the updates related to gradle and moving package into build files. To start, run `Tools -> AGP Upgrade Assistant`.

### Update Android Project Variables

In your `variables.gradle` file, update your values to the following new minimums

```groovy
minSdkVersion = 24
compileSdkVersion = 36
targetSdkVersion = 36
androidxActivityVersion = '1.11.0'
androidxAppCompatVersion = '1.7.1'
androidxCoordinatorLayoutVersion = '1.3.0'
androidxCoreVersion = '1.17.0'
androidxFragmentVersion = '1.8.9'
coreSplashScreenVersion = '1.2.0'
androidxWebkitVersion = '1.14.0'
junitVersion = '4.13.2'
androidxJunitVersion = '1.3.0'
androidxEspressoCoreVersion = '3.7.0'
cordovaAndroidVersion = '14.0.1'
```

### Replace deprecated Gradle property name syntax

Gradle has deprecated the property name syntax and now recommends using an `=` before the value. While it only causes warnings at the moment, it will break in the future.

```diff
# app/build.gradle
android {
-    namespace "com.getcapacitor.myapp"
-    compileSdk rootProject.ext.compileSdkVersion
+    namespace = "com.getcapacitor.myapp"
+    compileSdk = rootProject.ext.compileSdkVersion
...
     defaultConfig {
...
         aaptOptions {
-            ignoreAssetsPattern '!.svn:!.git:!.ds_store:!*.scc:.*:!CVS:!thumbs.db:!picasa.ini:!*~'
+            ignoreAssetsPattern = '!.svn:!.git:!.ds_store:!*.scc:.*:!CVS:!thumbs.db:!picasa.ini:!*~' 

```


### Update google services plugin

```diff
# build.gradle

    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:8.7.2'
-       classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.4.2'
+       classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.4.4'

```



### Update gradle plugin to 8.13.0

```diff
# build.gradle

    dependencies {
-       classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:8.7.2'
+       classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:8.13.0'

```

### Update gradle wrapper to 8.14.3

```diff
# gradle-wrapper.properties

distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
distributionPath=wrapper/dists
- distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.11.1-all.zip
+ distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.14.3-all.zip
zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
zipStorePath=wrapper/dists
```

### Update kotlin version

If your project is using kotlin, update the `kotlin_version` variable to `'2.2.20'`.

### Add density to configChanges

To prevent the webView from being reloaded on app resize, add `density` to `configChanges` of the app `activity` in `AndroidManifest.xml`.

```diff
- android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden|keyboard|screenSize|locale|smallestScreenSize|screenLayout|uiMode|navigation"
+ android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden|keyboard|screenSize|locale|smallestScreenSize|screenLayout|uiMode|navigation|density"
```

## Plugins

Plugins have been updated to version 8.0.0, make sure to update them to use latest version.

The following plugin functionality has been modified or removed. Update your code accordingly.

### Action Sheet

- `androidxMaterialVersion` variable has been updated to `1.13.0`.

### Barcode Scanner

`scanOrientation` option has no effect for large screens (e.g. tablets) on Android 16 an higher. You may opt-out of this behavior in your app by adding &lt;property android:name="android.window.PROPERTY_COMPAT_ALLOW_RESTRICTED_RESIZABILITY" android:value="true" /&gt; to your AndroidManifest.xml inside &lt;application&gt; or &lt;activity&gt;. Keep in mind though that this opt-out is temporary will no longer work for Android 17. Android discourages setting specific orientations for large screens. Regular Android phones are unaffected by this change. For more information check the Android docs at https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/behavior-changes-16#adaptive-layouts


### Browser

- `androidxBrowserVersion` variable has been updated to `1.9.0`.

### Camera

- `androidxExifInterfaceVersion` variable has been updated to `1.4.1`.
- `androidxMaterialVersion` variable has been updated to `1.13.0`.

### Geolocation

- `kotlinxCoroutinesVersion` variable has been updated to `1.10.2`.
- The `timeout` property now gets applied to all requests on Android on iOS, as opposed to just web and `getCurrentPosition` on Android. This aligns with what is documented in the plugin. If you start experiencing timeouts when requesting location in your app, consider using a higher `timeout` value. For `watchPosition` on Android, you may use the `interval` parameter introduced in version 8.0.0.

### Google Maps

- `googleMapsPlayServicesVersion` variable has been updated to `19.2.0`.
- `googleMapsUtilsVersion` variable has been updated to `3.19.1`.
- `googleMapsKtxVersion` variable has been updated to `5.2.1`.
- `googleMapsUtilsKtxVersion` variable has been updated to `5.2.1`.
- `kotlinxCoroutinesVersion` variable has been updated to `1.10.2`.
- `androidxCoreKTXVersion` variable has been updated to `1.17.0`.
- `kotlin_version` variable has been updated to `2.2.20`.

### Push Notifications

- `firebaseMessagingVersion` variable has been updated to `25.0.1`.

### Screen Orientation

`lock` method has no effect for large screens (e.g. tablets) on Android 16 an higher. You may opt-out of this behavior in your app by adding &lt;property android:name="android.window.PROPERTY_COMPAT_ALLOW_RESTRICTED_RESIZABILITY" android:value="true" /&gt; to your AndroidManifest.xml inside &lt;application&gt; or &lt;activity&gt;. Keep in mind though that this opt-out is temporary will no longer work for Android 17. Android discourages setting specific orientations for large screens. Regular Android phones are unaffected by this change. For more information check the Android docs at https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/behavior-changes-16#adaptive-layouts

### Splash Screen

- `coreSplashScreenVersion` variable has been updated to `1.2.0`.

### Status Bar

Removes the `CAPNotifications.swift` and `CAPBridgeViewController.swift` that emitted `.capacitorViewDidAppear` and `.capacitorViewWillTransition` events.
You can listen for them from `@capacitor/ios`.
