# Swift Package Manager

Swift Packages are Apple's new first-party tool for software dependencies. Traditionally Capacitor has used CocoaPods for managing dependencies internally and for plugins, however now is the time to move to a supported solution.

Since Capacitor 6, you can choose between using CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager (SPM). Almost all current capacitor-team supported plugins support SPM, namely the plugins in <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor-plugins">capacitor-plugins</a>.

We've tried our best to make sure you don't have to change much about how you work with Capacitor to use SPM, but there are a few things to understand.

## How it works

When a Capacitor project is using SPM we use a 'Base SPM' package that will serve as the place that references all of your projects dependencies:

![Base SPM Picture](../../../static/img/v6/docs/ios/spm/base-spm.png)

The Capacitor CLI will modify the CapApp-SPM package when you sync new plugins. It is important you do not touch the contents here because the CLI can and will change things.

## Using SPM in a new Capacitor project

First we'll start with our normal `npm init @capacitor/app@latest`:

![Demo Step 1](../../../static/img/v6/docs/ios/spm/demo-step1.png)

Now we want to add the iOS platform to our project:

`npm install @capacitor/ios`

Next let's build the web project:

`npm run build`

After that is complete we can add the iOS project. We need to add the option `--packagemanager SPM` to the normal add command:

`npx cap add ios --packagemanager SPM`

Now you can use `npx cap open ios` to open the iOS project and run your app from there.

### Add and use a Capacitor Plugin with SPM

So let's add a plugin to this project and do something with that plugin. 

Start with installing the Capacitor App plugin:

`npm install @capacitor/app`

Then let's sync the web app. This will add the App plugin SPM to the iOS project:

`npx cap sync`

You can now use the App plugin normally.

## Using SPM in an existing Capacitor Project

First, ensure you have a backup of the current state of your project, either in source control or elsewhere.

### Deleting your iOS Directory

If you **have not manually changed your Xcode Project at all**, one option to migrate is to delete the `ios` directory and then run `npx cap add ios --packagemanager SPM`. This will remove the CocoaPods template project and replace it with the SPM template project.  

### Using our migration tool

The Capacitor CLI has a command to help migrate from CocoaPods to Swift Package Manager. However, two manual steps are still required. Some things to note are: Projects with Cordova plugins should work, but may not be migrated correctly as we have to generate a `package.swift` file for them. In addition, projects that use capacitor plugins that do not have SPM versions available, will fail to work properly and will show a warning during migration and when running `npx cap sync`.

To start, run `npx cap spm-migration-assistant` in the root of your project.

This tool will:
  - Run `pod deintegrate` removing CocoaPods
  - Delete the `Podfile`, `App.xcworkspace`, and `Podfile.lock`
  - Create a `CapApp-SPM` directory with the needed files
  - Generate a `Package.swift` from your plugins, and warn you if any can't be included.
  - Add a `debug.xcconfig` to your ios project directory

Then run `npx cap open ios` and you should see something similar to this:

![Migrate Step 1](../../../static/img/spm/xcode-step-1.png)

Highlight App, and Select the Package Dependencies tab, and on this page press the + symbol to add a dependency:

![Migrate Step 2](../../../static/img/spm/xcode-step-2.png)

You should see something similar to the below - select Add Local... from the dialog:

![Migrate Step 3](../../../static/img/spm/xcode-step-3.png)

Select CapApp-SPM in this dialog and click Add Package:

![Migrate Step 4](../../../static/img/spm/xcode-step-4.png)

Click Add Package again when this screen shows up: 

![Migrate Step 5](../../../static/img/spm/xcode-step-5.png)

When you are done, you should see a screen like this. Now, move onto the next section about Adding `debug.xconfig`

![Migrate Step 6](../../../static/img/spm/xcode-step-6.png)

#### Adding debug.xcconfig to project 

From the app info tab, select Add Configuration file...

![XCConfig Step 1](../../../static/img/spm/xcconfig-step1.png)

Then select the file called `debug.xcconfig`

![XCConfig Step 2](../../../static/img/spm/xcconfig-step2.png)

Finally select xcconfig as your selection

![XCConfig Step 3](../../../static/img/spm/xcconfig-step3.png)

At this point you're done and can build and work as normal.

### Converting existing plugins to SPM

If your plugin only contains Swift aside from the required `[Name]Plugin.m` and `[Name]Plugin.h` you can use the [capacitor-plugin-converter](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor-plugin-converter)

This tool will add the following required things to your main swift plugin file, `[Name]Plugin.swift`:

- Add Conformance to the `CAPBridgedPlugin` protocol to your class
- Add 3 variables to your class. `identifier`, `jsName`, and `pluginMethods`
  - `identifer` will correspond to the first argument to the `CAP_PLUGIN` macro
  - `jsName` will correspond to the second argument to the `CAP_PLUGIN` macro
  - `pluginMethods` will be an array of the methods passed to the `CAP_PLUGIN` macro
- The following files will be removed as they are no longer needed:
  - `Plugin.xcodeproj`
  - `Plugin.xcworkspace`
  - `Info.plist`
  - `Podfile`
- To fit SPM best practices, the Project files will be moved to `Sources` and `Tests` directories
- The plugins `package.json` will get the following fixes:
  - The files array will add these files or directories:
    - `ios/Sources`
    - `ios/Tests`
    - `Package.swift`
  - `verify:ios` will be changed to `xcodebuild -scheme YourPluginName -destination generic/platform=iOS` to allow it to continue to work as you expect.
- Your plugin podspec will be changed so that `s.source_files` now points to the `Sources` director rather than the `Plugin` directory


See the documentation in the repository at [capacitor-plugin-converter](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor-plugin-converter) for more.

### Troubleshooting

After adding plugins try to 'reset package caches' in Xcode:
