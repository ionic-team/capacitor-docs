## Community Maintenance

Capacitor has been 100% open source (MIT) since the very beginning, and always will be. Developers can ensure Capacitor is the right choice for their cross-platform apps through Capacitor's community maintenance strategy. The Capacitor team regularly ships new releases, bug fixes, and is very welcoming to community pull requests.

## Capacitor Maintenance and Support Status

Given the reality of time and resource constraints as well as the need to support the ever-evolving landscape of mobile platforms, over time it becomes necessary for the Capacitor team to release new major versions. However, Capacitor will do everything it can to make the transition to newer versions as smooth as possible. The Capacitor team recommends updating to the newest version of Capacitor for the latest features, improvements and stability updates.

The current status of each Capacitor version is:

| Version |      Status      |    Released    | Maintenance Ends  | Ext. Support Ends |
| :-----: | :--------------: | :------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: |
|   V6    |    **Active**    | April 15, 2024 |        TBD        |        TBD        |
|   V5    |   Maintenance    |   May 3, 2023  | October 15, 2024  |  April 15, 2025   |
|   V4    |  End of Support  |  July 27, 2022 | November 3, 2023  |    May 3, 2024    |

## Compatibility Recommendations

The Capacitor team has compiled a set of recommendations for using the Capacitor in conjunction with other contextually-relevant software. This is not meant to be a comprehensive list, but covers many common compatibility questions. The Capacitor team strongly recommends reviewing your project dependencies once each quarter to keep track of new releases, features and bug fixes.

## Minimum Supported Platforms

Each Capacitor version sets a minimum version for each of its supported platforms. The Capacitor team strives to support as wide a range of versions as possible. With each major release, the team evaluates the minimum versions for each platform and makes adjustments as needed, based on both usage and technical constraints.

|    v6     |        13.0         |      5.1 (API 22)       |
