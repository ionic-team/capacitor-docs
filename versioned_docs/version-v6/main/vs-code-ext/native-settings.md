Click `Configuration` > `Properties` to change:

- **Display Name** - The name shown underneath the icon on the home screen.
- **Bundle Identifier** - The unique identifier for your application.
- **Version Number** - The Major and minor version number (eg `2.5`).
- **Build Number** - The build number usually associated with the version number (eg `3`).
