Apple recently introduced new [privacy protocols for third-party SDKs](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=3d8a9yyh) at WWDC23, requiring SDK authors to declare approved reasons for API usage within their SDKs to enhance transparency and user privacy.

Starting March 13th, 2024, App Store Connect will notify users when a new or updated app is uploaded without approved reasons to access certain APIs.

**Starting May 1st, 2024, you will be required to include approved reasons when submitting a new or updated app to App Store Connect.**

## Steps to Meet Requirements

Not all Applications will be flagged but certain plugins such as `@capacitor/filesystem` and `@capacitor/preferences` may necessitate a Privacy Manifest File. If you have received a notification:

1. Update Capacitor to:
a. `>= 6.0.0` for Capacitor 6
b. `>= 5.7.4` for Capacitor 5
c. `>= 4.8.2` for Capacitor 4
d. Capacitor <= 3 is not supported
2. Use either the VS Code Extension to create the privacy manifest file for your app or create it manually.

### VS Code Extension

Make sure you have the [Ionic VS Code extension](https://ionic.link/vscode) installed and open your project.

Under recommendations you will see *Add Privacy Manifest* if your application is using a plugin that uses certain APIs.

![No Manifest](/img/v4/docs/ios/no-manifest.png)

Choose Yes to create the bare minimum privacy manifest file.

The extension will then list all changes needed as recommendations titled *Missing Privacy Manifest Category*. For example:

![Privacy Change](/img/v4/docs/ios/privacy-change.png)

You must select one of the reason codes to explain how you use the plugin. If you are unsure, click *Docs* to go to the Apple’s documentation on the explanations of each reason code.

Please note that the VS Code extension has a set of rules for known plugins to help you. If you are still being rejected by Apple for missing privacy manifest reasons it may be that you are using a plugin that the extension does not know. You can open an issue on the [VS Code extension issue tracker](https://github.com/ionic-team/vscode-extension/issues).

### Manual Steps

If you would prefer to perform the steps for creating a Privacy Manifest file manually open Xcode then:

Choose *File > New File*.

Scroll down to the *Resource* section and select *App Privacy File* type.

Click *Next*.

Check your app in the *Targets* list.

Click *Create*.

A filed called `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` will be created. This file is challenging to create interactively in the Xcode UI so it may be easier to edit it manually by right clicking it and choosing *Open with External Editor*.

As a sample file here is a `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` file that uses the UserDefaults API through its use of the `@capacitor/preferences` plugin.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>NSPrivacyTracking</key>
    <false/>
    <key>NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypes</key>
    <array>
      <dict>
        <key>NSPrivacyAccessedAPIType</key>
        <string>NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategoryUserDefaults</string>
        <key>NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypeReasons</key>
        <array>
          <string>CA92.1</string>
        </array>
      </dict>
    </array>
    <key>NSPrivacyTrackingDomains</key>
    <array/>
  </dict>
</plist>
```

To find code and plugins which may require privacy manifest changes you can use a script like [this one](https://github.com/Wooder/ios_17_required_reason_api_scanner) by running `sh required_reason_api_text_scanner.sh node_modules` .

To choose the correct reason codes (like `CA92.1` in the above example) you will need to read [Apple’s documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_use_of_required_reason_api).

## Before Store Submission

Before App store submission you may need to disclose user tracking, tracking domains or collection of other data types that are unique for your application. See [Apple’s documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files) for more information.
