# Game Development with Capacitor

Capacitor is a great platform for building cross-platform games. With broad support for WebGL and canvas rendering, developers can build high-performance game experiences on modern mobile devices.

We generally recommend building with a game engine, which will provide primitives for common game objects and features, though developers are free to build from scratch.

## Phaser + Capacitor

[Phaser](https://phaser.io/) is one of the most popular web-based game development engines.

To get started building games with Capacitor and Phaser, see the [Capacitor + Phaser Starter template](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor-starters/tree/main/phaser), which includes consideration for mobile device scaling and defaulting to landscape mode.
