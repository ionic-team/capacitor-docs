# Capacitor Community Plugins

The community has built a number of Capacitor plugins to add functionality to your app.

There are a number of ways to find community plugins: Search the web or npm to find any published plugins, or explore the official [Capacitor Community](https://github.com/capacitor-community) GitHub org and [npm scope](https://npmjs.com/~capacitor-community) for a curated list of quality, community-supported Capacitor plugins.

## Capacitor Community

The official [Capacitor Community](https://github.com/capacitor-community) GitHub org and [npm scope](https://npmjs.com/~capacitor-community) is a new effort to curate the best Capacitor community-supported plugins and provide consistent project and code conventions. The Capacitor core team facilitates work but does not officially maintain any plugins in this org.

## Capawesome

The [Capawesome](https://github.com/capawesome-team) GitHub org is another community project by one of our Ionic Developer Experts with the goal of providing awesome Capacitor plugins for the entire community.
Among others, this includes [capacitor-firebase](https://github.com/capawesome-team/capacitor-firebase) and [capacitor-mlkit](https://github.com/capawesome-team/capacitor-mlkit).
Check out the [Capawesome Blog](https://capawesome.io/blog/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/capawesomeio) to stay up to date.

## Cordova Ecosystem

Capacitor has support for most Cordova plugins, so developers can use the [hundreds of existing Cordova plugins](https://cordova.apache.org/plugins/) in their Capacitor apps. While certain Cordova plugins are [not compatible](/plugins/cordova.md#known-incompatible-plugins) with Capacitor, most are, so it's worth trying one if there's no existing Capacitor-specific plugin available.

Also see the [`@awesome-cordova-plugins` Community](https://github.com/danielsogl/awesome-cordova-plugins) plugins for a list of primarily Cordova plugins with convenient wrappers to make them easier to use in your apps. Feel free to use the `@awesome-cordova-plugins` Community wrappers or simply use the list as a reference for quality Cordova plugins.
