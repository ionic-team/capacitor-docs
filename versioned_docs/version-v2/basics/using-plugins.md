# Using Capacitor Plugins

Capacitor ships with a number of built-in plugins, such as [Camera](/apis/camera.md) and [Filesystem](/apis/filesystem.md).

However, chances are your app will need to access more native functionality than provided out of the box in Capacitor.

Fortunately, you can quickly add your own native functionality by writing a small amount of native code then exposing it as a Capacitor plugin by following the [Plugin Guide](/plugins.md).

## Finding Plugins

The community has built a number of plugins for various native functionality and you can easily add them to your app.

See our [Community Plugins](/plugins/community.md) list for some options.

## Using Cordova and Ionic Native Plugins

Capacitor also supports a wide range of [Cordova plugins](/cordova/using-cordova-plugins.md), so there are a lot to choose from.
