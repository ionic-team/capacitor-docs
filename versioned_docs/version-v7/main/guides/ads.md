# Advertisements in Capacitor Apps

Many consumer apps need to display ads in order to generate revenue.

The most popular ad network for mobile apps is Google Admob, and there is a [community-maintained Capacitor plugin](https://github.com/capacitor-community/admob) ready to use:

```shell
npm install @capacitor-community/admob
npx cap update
```

Then, follow the [Capacitor Community Admob](https://github.com/capacitor-community/admob) documentation for configuration and usage.

This [community article](https://medium.com/enappd/implement-admob-in-ionic-react-capacitor-apps-ebc7af360b41) is also a useful reference for practical applications of this plugin (though it is using an older version of the plugin).
